Once oil is hot and shimmering, add 1 fillet, lowering it into the pan away from you, skin side down.

Cook fish, pressing periodically with spatula, until fish is nearly cooked through (it should still be opaque and a bit raw at the thickest part of the fillet), about 3 minutes. Gently turn fish (working away from you so the oil doesn't splash on you) and finish cooking off heat, about another minute or so.",
