            "Prep the broiler and marshmallows. Set the broiler to high heat and place the oven rack about 6 inches below the heating elements.  Arrange the marshmallows on a sheet pan in a single even layer, so that no marshmallows are overlapping.  Set aside until ready to use.",
            "Brown the butter. Heat the butter in a large stockpot over medium high heat until it has melted and begins to foam, stirring frequently to ensure that the butter cooks evenly.  Keep a close eye on the butter as it continues to cook, stirring frequently, until the butter starts to turn golden brown and smells toasty.  Once the butter reaches this stage, immediately remove the pan from the heat and pour the butter into a heatproof dish momentarily, so that the cooking process will be halted.  Set aside while you toast the marshmallows.",
            "“Toast” the marshmallows. Once the butter is ready to go, place the pan of marshmallows in the oven and broil for 30 to 60 seconds, until the marshmallows are puffy and deeply golden on top.  (They cook quickly, so keep a very close eye on them!)  Remove the pan from the oven.",
            "Stir everything together. Moving quickly throughout this step, pour the browned butter back into the stockpot, along with the bourbon and salt, and briefly stir to combine.  Immediately transfer the toasted marshmallows to the stockpot (I find it’s easiest to do this with a large spatula) and briefly stir to combine.  Add in the Rice Krispies and stir until they are more or less evenly coated.  It’s ok if there are some marshmallow clumps in there.",
            "Press into the baking dish. Transfer the mixture to a parchment-lined (or greased) 9 x 9-inch baking dish, and gently press the mixture down into an even layer.  Let the rice crispy treats cool until they reach room temperature.",

(Cooking time will depend on the size of your eggplants and garlic cloves.) Transfer the baking sheet to a wire cooling rack and let the eggplants rest flesh-side-down, undisturbed, for about 20 minutes so that the eggplant flesh can continue to steam inside of its skins.",

(I recommend measuring the temperature with a cooking thermometer, but if you don’t have one, the mixture should be warm but not hot to the touch. If the mixture gets too hot, just wait a few minutes for it to cool.)",

In a separate large mixing bowl, briefly whisk together the flour, sugar, yeast, ground cardamom and salt until combined.  Add the warm milk mixture and stir until the dough begins to form. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for 7-10 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and soft.",
            "First dough rise. Form the dough into a ball, place it in a greased bowl and cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap.  Let the dough rise in a warm space for 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size.",

Take one strip and twist it several times, gently stretching it as you do so until it nearly doubles in length. Grab one end of the twisted strip and loosely wrap the dough around two fingers twice, like a bandage.  Then loop the rest of the dough perpendicularly around the dough so that it forms a knot, and tuck the loose end in at the bottom.  Transfer the dough to a large parchment-covered baking sheet, and repeat with the remaining dough strips.  (Here is a great visual for twisting the dough, or you can watch my step-by-step Instagram tutorial here.)",

            "Cook the other side of the tortilla.  Return the skillet to the heat, and slide the tortilla from the plate back into the skillet to cook the second side.  Run a spatula around the edges of the tortilla to tuck the sides back under so that the edges are nice and rounded.  Cook for another 2 minutes, until the bottom of the tortilla is also lightly golden.  Then slide the tortilla onto a clean plate.",
            "Serve warm.  Or let the tortilla cool to room temperature.  Seal tightly with plastic wrap and either refrigerate for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 3 months."

Flip the steak, and cook on the other side until browned, about another 3 minutes. Then remove steak from pan with a slotted spoon, and transfer to a separate plate. Set aside.  (**If your pan is not big enough to fit all of the steak in a single layer, then add just 1 tablespoon of butter to the pan and cook half of the steak. Then repeat with a second batch.**)",

Continue sauteing for an additional 5-7 minutes, or until the mushrooms are cooked and the onions are soft. Add the white wine, and deglaze the pan by using your cooking spoon to scrape the brown bits off the bottom of the pan. Let the mixture cook down for an additional 3 minutes.",
            "Meanwhile, in a separate bowl, whisk together the beef broth, worcestershire sauce and flour until smooth. Pour the beef broth mixture into the pan, and stir to combine. Let the mixture simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Then stir in the Greek yogurt (or sour cream) until combined, and then stir the cooked steak back in. Season with additional salt and pepper if needed.",

            "Once the pork is tender, use some tongs to transfer it onto a cutting board.  Then shred it into bite-sized pieces using two forks.  Return the pork to the soup and stir to combine.  Also, if you’d like a thinner broth, add in an extra cup or two of chicken stock to thin it out.",

Stir in the garlic and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until fragrant, stirring occasionally. Remove pan from heat and set aside.",

(The cake can be refrigerated for up to 4 days.)",

Fold the two opposite sides of the tortilla in so that they meet and overlap, then fold in the two remaining open ends so that the entire burrito is sealed. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap so that the entire burrito is very tightly sealed. (I find it easiest to fold the plastic wrap over the two short ends, then the longer sides of the burrito.)

            "Meanwhile, as the pasta water is heating, melt butter in a (separate) medium saute pan over medium-high heat.  Add garlic and saute for 1 minute or until fragrant, stirring occasionally.  Whisk in the flour until combined and cook for an additional 1 minute, whisking occasionally.  Slowly whisk in vegetable or chicken stock until the mixture is smooth.  Then slowly whisk in the milk until it is combined.  Continue cooking for 1-2 minutes, or until the mixture comes to a simmer.  Then remove from heat, and stir in the cheddar, Parmesan, salt and pepper until the cheese sauce is smooth.  Remove from heat.",

            "At this point, you can either serve the pasta stovetop-style as-is.  Or pour the pasta into a greased 9 x 13-inch baking dish, and sprinkle with extra cheddar cheese and Panko breadcrumbs.  Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the top becomes slightly crispy and the breadcrumbs are slightly golden.  Remove and serve immediately.",
            "*To cook the chicken breasts on the stove top, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large saute pan.  Pound chicken to even thickness, and sprinkle both sides with a few generous pinches of salt and pepper.  Add to the pan and cook for 3-4 minutes per side, or until the chicken is cooked through and no longer pink inside.  (Cooking times will vary depending on the thickness of your chicken.)  Or, to bake the chicken breasts in the oven, follow these instructions.",
            "**If making the baked version of this dish, I recommend ever-so-slightly undercooking your pasta, as it will cook a bit more while it bakes in the oven."

Add the flour mixture and egg, and beat on medium-low speed until combined. If the dough is sticking to the sides of the bowl, add the remaining flour, 1/4 cup at a time, until the dough begins to form a ball and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Continue beating for 5 minutes on medium-low speed. Remove the dough hook and cover the dough with a damp towel and let rest for 10 minutes.",

(If you want all edges to be even, you can use a pizza slicer to cut the dough into a perfect rectangle.) Use a knife or spoon to spread the Nutella evenly over the top of the surface, leaving a 1/4-inch border at the bottom of the 14-inch edge (so that the Nutella doesn’t ooze out). Sprinkle the cinnamon evenly on top of the Nutella. (If it’s too thick, pop the Nutella in the microwave for a few seconds to make it easier to spread.)",
            "Beginning at the top 14-inch edge (the edge with the Nutella spread clear to the border), tightly roll up the dough. Then give the final seam a little pinch so that it seals. Use a piece of dental floss*** to “cut” off the two ends of the roll (an inch on each end – discard that dough) so that they are even. Then cut the remaining dough into 11 or 12 equal pieces. (11 rolls seem to fit in a pie plate, while 12 rolls fit in a rectangular pan.)",

(I typically turn on my oven to 200 degrees, then turn it off and place the dish in the oven with the door cracked open. It’s a great option if you don’t have a vent or a warm window nearby.)",

If needed, let the milk mixture sit for a few minutes until it is warm but not hot.",

Stir by hand to combine. Add the egg and milk mixture, and beat on medium-low speed until combined. Add the remaining flour, 1/4 cup at a time, beating after each addition until incorporated. When the dough begins to form a ball and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, you have added enough flour. Continue beating for 5 minutes on medium-low speed. Remove the dough hook and cover the dough with a damp towel and let rest for 10 minutes.",
            "Meanwhile, begin making your filling by whisking together sugars and cinnamon in a bowl until combined.",
            "When the dough is ready, turn it out onto a floured work surface. Then use a floured rolling pin to roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about 14 x 9 inches in size. (If you want all edges to be even, you can use a pizza slicer to cut the dough into a perfect rectangle. Don’t worry about cutting away extra dough — this recipe makes plenty.) Use a knife or pastry spatula to spread the softened butter out evenly over the entire surface of the dough. Then sprinkle evenly with the cinnamon and sugar mixture. Then sprinkle on the finely chopped apples, and drizzle with 1/2 cup caramel sauce.",
            "Beginning at the 14-inch edge, tightly roll up the dough. And then give the final seam a little pinch so that it seals. Use a piece of dental floss* to “cut” off the two ends of the roll (just a centimeter or so) so that they are even. Then cut the remaining dough into 11 or 12 equal pieces. (11 rolls seem to fit in a pie plate, while 12 rolls fit in a rectangular pan.)",
            "(*To cut dough with dental floss, simply break off a piece of floss about 12 inches long. Then very carefully slide the middle of the floss under the dough to the place where you want to “cut”. Then pull the ends of the floss up and cross over the top of the dough. Then give a quick tug to literally cut all the way through the dough. This is the best method for not squishing your dough while cutting it — although the standard knife method still works too.)",
            "Place each of the cut cinnamon rolls into a greased pie plate or 9 x 13-inch baking dish. Then cover again with a damp towel, and leave the dish in a warm place to rise for 25 minutes. (I typically turn on my oven to 200 degrees, then turn it off and place the dish in the oven with the door cracked open. It’s a great option if you don’t have a vent or a warm window nearby.)",
            "When the rolls have risen, uncover the dish. Then place on the center rack of the oven and bake at 350 degrees F for 15-20 minutes, or until the rolls are golden and cooked through. Remove and let cool on a wire rack for at least 5 minutes. Drizzle with remaining caramel sauce and serve."

Cut off the top 1 to 1 1/2 inch of the artichoke, then use kitchen shears to trim the spiky tops of the outer leaves. Put the artichoke in the boiling water and cover. If your artichokes are too big, and you can’t put the lid on, place a heatproof bowl on top of them to weigh them down while they cook. Cook for 20 to 25 minutes, until you can pull away an outer leaf without too much resistance.",

Taste and season again with salt and pepper.",

Use a teaspoon or a measuring spoon to scoop out the choke, the hairy fibers inside the middle of the artichoke. Be careful not to scoop out too much of the heart, which is the soft, tasty solid just under the choke. Running your finger around the inside of the artichoke helps find stray choke fibers.",

To eat, pull off the leaves and scrape them along your bottom teeth, picking up stuffing as you go. Once you eat all of the leaves, cut the heart into chunks and eat with remaining stuffing on the plate."
